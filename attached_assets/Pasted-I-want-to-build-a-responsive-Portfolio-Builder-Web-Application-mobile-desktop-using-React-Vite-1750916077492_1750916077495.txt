I want to build a responsive Portfolio Builder Web Application (mobile + desktop) using React + Vite as the frontend framework. This application will allow users to sign up / log in, design personal portfolio websites using a drag-and-drop interface, and then one-click deploy their portfolio to the web using Vercel‚Äôs deployment API, returning a public URL. Here's a breakdown of the detailed functionality, architecture, and requirements:

üåê High-Level Product Vision
A Wix-like no-code builder, specifically focused on developer/design portfolios, with:

Pre-built customizable portfolio templates (think: About Me, Projects, Experience, Skills, Contact).

Easy drag-and-drop editor for users to build UIs from pre-defined blocks.

Live preview of the portfolio in real time.

One-click "Publish" feature that:

Builds the static files.

Pushes the build to Vercel automatically via API.

Returns a live URL for the user to access and share.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
‚úÖ Frontend (React + Vite)
React (functional components, hooks, context)

Vite for blazing-fast bundling and dev experience

Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

Drag-and-drop functionality using @dnd-kit/core or react-beautiful-dnd

State management: React Context or Zustand

Routing: react-router-dom

Form handling: react-hook-form or Formik

‚úÖ Backend (Optional, for Auth + Storage)
Node.js + Express or Firebase backend

Authentication: Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or JWT-based Node API

Database: Firestore, Supabase DB, or MongoDB Atlas for storing:

User profiles

Portfolio JSON layout data

Metadata (deployment URL, timestamps, etc.)

‚úÖ Deployment Integration
Use Vercel REST API or @vercel/client npm package to programmatically:

Create a project

Upload built assets

Deploy from user's build

Fetch deployment URL

üß© Key Functional Modules
1. Authentication
Signup/Login page (email/password, optional OAuth)

JWT/session-based user auth

User metadata saved in DB

2. Dashboard UI
"Create New Portfolio" option

Option to edit previous portfolios

List of past deployments with live URLs

3. Portfolio Editor
Drag-and-drop canvas area

Sidebar for selecting components (e.g., Header, Project, Skills, etc.)

Ability to edit text, images, themes

JSON-based layout representation for persistency

Live preview panel

4. Save & Publish
Save layout data to DB

On ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù, generate a static React app from layout JSON:

Use a builder script to convert layout to a static React/Vite app

Zip or prepare the file system

Push to Vercel using API

Return and store deployment URL

5. Public Portfolio
URL structure: https://<username>.vercel.app

SEO-optimized, responsive React site

Clean public view (no editor controls)

üì¶ Extra Capabilities (Future Enhancements)
Theme switching (light/dark/custom palette)

Upload custom domain

Export as zip (static site)

Analytics dashboard for portfolio views

Resume parsing/upload module

Integration with GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.

PDF Portfolio generation from online version

üß† AI Model Instruction
As an AI model, you are expected to:

Build or assist in building the frontend drag-and-drop editor using React + Vite.

Design a data model to convert drag-and-drop UI state into deployable React code.

Create scripts/functions to automatically generate deployable code structure from JSON.

Integrate with Vercel deployment APIs for publishing user sites programmatically.

Build a system that is responsive, optimized for both mobile and desktop, and production-grade.

Maintain a component library of reusable blocks (custom UI components).

Optimize for performance and scalability.

Return deploy status, logs, and URL after publishing.
